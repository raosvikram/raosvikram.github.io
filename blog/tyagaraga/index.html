<p>On a long road trip in the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, I was stuck behind a
lady driving at 30 mph on a 55 mph street. Being a law-abiding citizen who shuns
road rage, I vented out my frustration through a passionate and short
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallavi">Pallavi</a> in the raga
<a href="http://www.ragasurabhi.com/carnatic-music/raga/raga--pantuvarali.html">Pantuvarali</a>
set to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9g3j4ysYc">five beat cycle</a>.</p>

<p>nI bAdhamEmiTi ammA, nAku teliyarAda \

</blockquote>
<p>While that made for a memorable few hours of improvisational music <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, what
struck me the most was that my friend was impressed with the realistic line I
had come up with. While coming up with a line appropriate to the situation
is definitely a hard problem, I felt it shouldn&rsquo;t be very difficult to generate
coherent, realistic-sounding lines.</p>
<p>In fact, the requirement of making semantic sense could be safely dropped
because:</p>
<ol>
<li>said friend didn&rsquo;t speak Telugu and would&rsquo;ve bought into anything that
sounded authentic.</li>
<li>the brain is great at filling gaps (or else most jokes wouldn&rsquo;t work), and
even a moderately creative person will make sense of almost anything.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of this post is about how I went about verifying this hunch.</p>
<h2 id="idea">Idea</h2>
<p>The simplest statistical model that can generate language is an <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/lzhang10/slm.html">n-gram language
model</a>. Such a model gobbles up
text and only remembers how often sequences of words occur together - it doesn&rsquo;t
&ldquo;understand&rdquo; anything per se, and in addition, is restricted to short sequences
of words <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I should add that natural language processing is a decades-old field and the
current state of the art consists of vastly more superior methods <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. The flip
side is that these sophisticated methods require much more data than I had.</p>
<p>The goal was then to train an n-gram language model using as many of Tyagaraja&rsquo;s
compositions as I could lay my hands on and see what came out.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>A general challenge in using computational methods for classical works is that
they span multiple centuries and straddle many different cultural eras through
which the language itself would have evolved. In other words, the amount of data
available in a particular linguistic &ldquo;era&rdquo; is limited. The issue is worsened in
our case because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music">carnatic music</a>
was composed in multiple languages and the good folks who composed in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language">Telugu</a> passed away in the 18th
century, leaving behind only a precious few thousand compositions.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no standard way of romanizing Indian languages, which
makes the data hard to clean and also adds to data sparsity (heuristics go only
so far in cleaning the data, and patience is a scarce resource!)</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>I scraped many popular websites hosting carnatic music lyrics and picked the one
that was easiest to parse and most consistent. I then cleaned up the data a
little, but did not stem the words.</p>
<p>I only had 700 songs and so didn&rsquo;t prune the vocabulary. There were 13k words,
30k pairs and 33k triples. The lists of top n-grams will be of no surprise.</p>
<ol>
<li>Top words: <code>rAma</code>, <code>SrI</code>, <code>tyAgarAja</code></li>
<li>Top pairs: <code>SrI rAma</code>, <code>tyAgarAja nuta</code>, <code>rAma END</code></li>
<li>Top triples: <code>tyAgarAja nuta END</code>, <code>tyAgarAja vinuta END</code>, <code>O manasA END</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I wrote a node.js app which sampled <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> from this trigram language model
50% of the times and from the unigram distribution the rest of the times and
hosted it on Heroku. I also wanted the generated lyrics to be stored somewhere
so I eventually made a Twitter bot to tweet out lyrics every 15 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="sample-lyrics">Sample lyrics</h2>
<p>These samples span the full spectrum from profoundly philosophical to hilarious.
