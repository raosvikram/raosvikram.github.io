      <description>I recently had the wonderful opportunity to drive cross-country from upstate New York to the San Francisco bay area as I moved out west from Cornell. I was alone on the road for three weeks and went to 13 national parks, even sleeping in my car at Yellowstone.&#xA;A lot can be written about the diverse terrain of the USA and the mountainous state highways of Montana with 70+ mph speed limits, but the trip was also a great time to reflect and think about my priorities in life.</description>

      <description>Background On a long road trip in the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, I was stuck behind a lady driving at 30 mph on a 55 mph street. Being a law-abiding citizen who shuns road rage, I vented out my frustration through a passionate and short Pallavi in the raga Pantuvarali set to a five beat cycle.&#xA;nI bAdhamEmiTi ammA, nAku teliyarAda \ What is your problem, lady? I do not comprehend it.</description>
