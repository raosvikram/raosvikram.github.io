      <description>I am a Software Engineer at Facebook. Before that, I was at GoogleAI working on various applied NLP problems, and even before at Twitter, contributing several key pieces to its shift from a reverse-chronological timeline to a relevance-ranked feed.
In a previous life, I worked on applied NLP in the CS PhD program at Cornell , which I discontinued with an MS after two years. Even before, I was a CSE undergraduate at IIT Madras where I was generously supported by the Aditya Birla Scholarship and OPJEMS.</description>

      <description>Background On a long road trip in the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, I was stuck behind a lady driving at 30 mph on a 55 mph street. Being a law-abiding citizen who shuns road rage, I vented out my frustration through a passionate and short Pallavi in the raga Pantuvarali set to a five beat cycle.

What is your problem, lady? I do not comprehend it.</description>
