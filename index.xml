      <description>I am a Software Engineer in the Research and Machine Intelligence team at Google. Before that, I worked on Timeline ranking at Twitter, contributing several key pieces to Twitter&amp;rsquo;s shift from a reverse-chronological timeline to a relevance-ranked feed.
In a previous life, I worked on applied NLP in the CS PhD program at Cornell , which I discontinued with an MS after two years. Even before, I was a CSE undergraduate at IIT Madras where I was generously supported by the Aditya Birla Scholarship and OPJEMS.</description>

      <description>I recently had the wonderful opportunity to drive cross-country from upstate New York to the San Francisco bay area as I moved out west from Cornell. I was alone on the road for three weeks and went to 13 national parks, even sleeping in my car at Yellowstone.
A lot can be written about the diverse terrain of the USA and the mountainous state highways of Montana with 70+ mph speed limits, but the trip was also a great time to reflect and think about my priorities in life.</description>

      <description>Background On a long road trip in the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, I was stuck behind a lady driving at 30 mph on a 55 mph street. Being a law-abiding citizen who shuns road rage, I vented out my frustration through a passionate and short Pallavi in the raga Pantuvarali set to a five beat cycle.
 nI bAdhamEmiTi ammA, nAku teliyarAda What is your problem, lady? I do not comprehend it.</description>
